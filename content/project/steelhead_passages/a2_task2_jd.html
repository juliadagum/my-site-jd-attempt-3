<p>Steelhead are found in the Columbia River on the border of Oregon and Washington. Steelhead are a salmonid species of fish that are born in freshwater rivers, migrate to the ocean and return to freshwater to spawn. The graphs below show the daily counts of steelhead passages at the Bonneville Dam from 1938 to 2019.</p>

<h3>Steelhead Time-Series Plot</h3>
<p>The time-series plot below displays the seasonality in steelhead salmon passages from 1938-2019. As can be interpreted from the graph, steelhead return to Bonneville Dam yearly as part of their annual migration.</p>

<h3>Steelhead Seasonplot</h3>

<h3>Annual Steelhead Counts</h3>
<p>The line graph below shows the total annual steelhead counts from 1938-2019. This graph shows that steelhead salmon increased in abundance overall between 1980 and 2010, but their populations have dropped markedly in the past decade.</p>
