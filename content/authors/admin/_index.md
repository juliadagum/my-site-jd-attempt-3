Julia Dagum, a first-year master’s student, graduated from Cornell University in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Sciences and a minor in English. As an undergraduate, Julia conducted research in primate abundance on Bioko Island and sustainable olive pest management in Italy. She then worked in community outreach for the City of Sunnyvale’s sustainability team as a Climate Corps Fellow and later taught marine science to elementary school children. Most recently, Julia served as Communications Specialist for Silicon Valley Clean Energy. In this role, she was responsible for strategic marketing through articles, videos and community engagement to educate residents about their local electricity provider. After exploring a wide range of interests within the environmental field, she is now specializing in Energy and Climate at the Bren School. Julia aims to improve her technical skills and understanding of economics and policy to work towards eliminating our global dependence on fossil fuels.
